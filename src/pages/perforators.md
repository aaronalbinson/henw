      **Hot Perforators**


      Our Hot Perforators have solid state heater controls with both internal
      and external heated pin rollers. Other features are a timer for automatic
      warm up, automatic speed control which matches the web speed to produce
      round holes, automatic cool down, fully guarded interlocks with emergency
      stop, heat shield for web protection, a remote station to stop and start
      production and pin segments which are easily interchangeable for different
      perforation patterns. The diameter of the holes can also be adjusted with
      the needle depth adjusters. The Hot Perforator can easily be installed on
      to slitter/rewind units, bag machines etc.
