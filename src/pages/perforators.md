  - paragraph: "# **Hot, Cold and Intermittent Perforators**\n\n**Hot Perforators**\n\nHot needle perforation is the method of producing micro perforations in modern substrates such as LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE and PP.\n\nThe process of hot needle perforation produces a perfectly round hole which is heat sealed or welded around the circumference, therefore retaining the strength and durability of the substrate.\n\nThese types of substrate are use widely within the food packaging industry to increase the shelve life of various fresh or frozen produce.\n\n**Our Hot Perforators** have solid state heater controls with both internal and external heated pin rollers.\r\n\nWe fit the Hot Perforation Machines with easily interchangeable pin segments of your choice to perforated the desired pattern.  The diameter of the holes can be adjusted with the needle depth adjuster.\r\n\nThe Hot Micro Perforation Units have a timer for automatic warm up, automatic speed control which matches the web speed to produce round holes and an automatic cool down feature.\r\n\nThe safety features built into the Hot Needle Perforation Machinery are full protecting guards interlocked with an emergency stop, heat shield for web protection and a remote control station with start and stop buttons.\r\n\nThe Perforators can easily be installed into your existing set up such as slitters or rewind units.\n\n![Hot  Needle Perforator / Hot Perforation Unit ](/img/hot-perforator-he-2.png)\n\n![](/img/front-face-1.png)\n\n- - -"
