      **Hot Needle Perforatoring Machine**


      Hot Needle Perforation\*\* \*\*is the method of producing micro
      perforations in modern substrates such as LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE and PP.


      The process of hot needle perforation produces a perfectly round hole
      which is heat sealed or welded around the circumference, therefore
      retaining the strength and durability of the substrate.


      These types of substrate are use widely within the food packaging industry
      to increase the shelf life of various fresh or frozen produce.


      Our Hot Perforators have solid state heater controls with both internal
      and external heated pin rollers.


      We fit the Hot Perforation Machines with easily interchangeable pin
      segments of your choice to perforated the desired pattern.  The diameter
      of the holes can be adjusted with the needle depth adjuster.


      The Hot Micro Perforation Units have a timer for automatic warm up,
      automatic speed control which matches the web speed to produce round holes
      and an automatic cool down feature.


      The safety features built into the Hot Needle Perforation Machinery are
      full protecting guards interlocked with an emergency stop, heat shield for
      web protection and a remote control station with start and stop buttons.


      The Perforators can easily be installed into your existing set up such as
      slitter rewinder units and film blow lines.
