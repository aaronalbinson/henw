      We are a family run company who specialise in the manufacture of machined
      components for numerous modern industries including packaging, lifting and
      printing, producing anything from bespoke one-off items and after market
      parts for often obsolete machinery to emergency repair work/reverse
      engineering.  We are capable of machining your standard  materials i.e.
      steel, stainless steel and non-ferrous metals and also we have vast
      experience in most modern composites and plastics used widely in todays
      industries. 


      We are the leading UK manufacturer of Hot and Cold Micro Perforation
      Machinery.  We manufacture our own bespoke Hot Needle Perforator Machine
      and Cold Needle Perforator Machine including all their consumables,
      selling these throughout the world.  


      Perforated film is used in a large number of sectors including:


      * Fruit and veg film packaging

      * fresh bread film packaging

      * pharmaceutical / medical supplies

      * building or roofing insulation manufacturers

      * other products with the need for air and moisture control.


      The lidding or packaging of perforated material allows the moisture to
      escape, which extends the product's freshness and shelf life
      considerably.  It also reduces the growth of mold in bagged farm produce.


      We also manufacture our own Manual Core Cutter capable of cutting plastic
      and cardboard cores for the paper converting industry.

      combined, this ensures you we offer the very best and most experienced
