      Pinned Sleeves


      Heritage Engineering's Pinned Sleeves can be used in both hot and cold
      perforating processes.  The Pinned Sleeves can be used on our own
      perforation machinery (PX5/PX9), as well as most existing perforating
      machines in use throughout the world.


      Patterns that can be produced by Heritage Engineering can be square,
      diamond or spiral and can be made interlocking for full web width
      perforation pattern or with the use of precision spacers for bespoke
      perforation patterns.
